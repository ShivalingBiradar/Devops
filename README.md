# Devops Learning 

This is my first Git Repository.

Git:

Version control system: Tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions, manage branches for parallel development, and collaborate effectively.
Local repository: Your copy of the project on your computer.
Remote repository: Hosted on GitHub or other platforms, where you push your local changes and collaborate with others.
Key commands: git init (initialize repository), git add (stage files for commit), git commit (save changes with message), git push (send changes to remote), git pull (receive changes from remote).

GitHub:

Web-based platform: Hosts Git repositories, providing collaborative features like issue tracking, pull requests, and code review.
Public and private repositories: Choose visibility for your projects.
Branching and merging: Create separate branches for features or bug fixes, merge them back into the main branch (master) when ready.
GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM): Use formatting for headings, code blocks, lists, etc. in your README.
